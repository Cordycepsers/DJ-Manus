# Manus DJ v3.0 ðŸŽ§ (Python & ytmusicapi Edition)

A personalized, automated daily music discovery system that runs on macOS. This project uses **Python**, the unofficial **`ytmusicapi`**, and the **Notion API** to create a new YouTube Music playlist every day, managed through a personal music database in Notion.

This version represents a significant architectural upgrade, moving from AppleScript and the official YouTube API to a more robust, streamlined, and powerful Python-based engine. It's faster, easier to maintain, and purpose-built for YouTube Music.

## How It Works

The system revolves around a central "Music Brain" database in Notion and is driven by a single Python script.

1.  **Notion Database:** The source of truth for your music library. It holds artists, albums, ratings, and a listening queue (`To Listen`, `Now Playing`, `Listened`).
2.  **The Python Engine (`manus_dj_final.py`):** The new core of the project performs a sophisticated daily routine:
    *   **Check the Queue:** It queries your Notion database for any tracks marked as `To Listen`.
    *   **Curate or Discover:**
        *   If the queue has tracks, it builds the daily playlist from them.
        *   If the queue is empty, it simulates a call to the Manus AI to get *new* recommendations.
    *   **Avoid Duplicates:** Before adding a new discovery, it checks your Notion database to ensure the artist hasn't been added before.
    *   **Build the Playlist:** It uses `ytmusicapi` to find the songs and create a new, private daily playlist directly in YouTube Music.
    *   **Update the Database:** After creating the playlist, it updates your Notion database, moving tracks from `To Listen` to `Now Playing`.
3.  **The Scheduler (`launchd`):** A native macOS agent triggers the Python script automatically at a set time every day.

## Features

-   **Streamlined & Powerful:** Built entirely in Python for reliability and performance.
-   **Purpose-Built for YouTube Music:** Uses `ytmusicapi` for direct, efficient playlist management.
-   **Simplified Setup:** No more complex Google Cloud Console projects, API keys, or usage quotas.
-   **Intelligent Music Queue:** Manages a "To Listen" list directly within Notion.
-   **Learning System:** Avoids recommending artists you already have in your database.
-   **Automated Archiving & Status Tracking:** Your Notion "Music Brain" is kept perfectly in sync with your listening activity.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Notion

(This is the same as v2.0. Create your "Music Brain" database with the required properties and get your **Notion API Key** and **Database ID**).

### Step 2: Set Up `ytmusicapi`

1.  **Install the library:** Open Terminal and run:
    ```bash
    pip3 install ytmusicapi requests
    ```
2.  **Authenticate:** In your project folder, run the authentication wizard:
    ```bash
    ytmusicapi oauth
    ```
3.  This will open your browser for you to grant permission. Once complete, it will create an `oauth.json` file in your project folder. This is all you need for authentication.

### Step 3: Configure the Project

1.  Clone this repository or download the files.
2.  **The Python script (`manus_dj_final.py`)** is ready to go. It reads credentials from the scheduler.
3.  **The Scheduler (`.plist` file):** Open `com.yourname.manusdj.plist`.
    -   Update the `Label` to be unique (e.g., `com.yourname.manusdj.python`).
    -   **Crucially**, update the path `/Users/yourusername/Projects/ManusDJ/manus_dj_final.py` to the correct absolute path of the Python script on your Mac.
    -   Inside the `<key>EnvironmentVariables</key>` section, replace the placeholder values for `NOTION_API_KEY` and `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` with your actual credentials.

### Step 4: Install and Run the Scheduler

1.  **Install the agent:** Copy the edited `.plist` file into the `~/Library/LaunchAgents` folder.
    ```bash
    cp com.yourname.manusdj.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    ```
2.  **Load the agent:** Open Terminal and run the following command to load the service. It will now run automatically at the scheduled time.
    ```bash
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourname.manusdj.plist
    ```

### To Run Manually

You can test the script at any time by navigating to your project folder in Terminal and running:
```bash
# You must first export the environment variables for a manual run
export NOTION_API_KEY="secret_YOUR_NOTION_API_KEY"
export NOTION_DATABASE_ID="YOUR_NOTION_DATABASE_ID"
export PLAYLIST_NAME="Manus DJ"

# Then run the script
python3 manus_dj_final.py
```
